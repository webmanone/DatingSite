# Dating Site

## Project Overview

This project is a dating site (work in progress) that focuses on matching users with people with similar interests to them.

### Why did I create this project?
The idea for this project first started when I was brainstorming for ideas of how to create a project that could tell hiring managers more about me and my interests.
I first started thinking along the lines of an online resume/profile that showed my past experience and hobbies. 
However, I wanted to create something that could potentially be used in real life and not just in an interview. 
I also wanted to create something that had unlimited potential for adding new features and implementing new technologies. 
Around this time I went on a date with a girl, and whilst we were eating I couldn't stop thinking about an Anime "Chainsaw Man" that had just released. 
I really wanted to ask this girl if she had watched chainsaw man, but I was 99% sure that she hadn't and I was worried that if I told her I like anime, it might negatively affect her opinion of me. 
Anime is an art form that has a lot of bad and good serios, but a common perception of someone hasn't watched anime before is that it's something that only weirdos enjoy. 
After the date, I kept thinking how cool it would be if I could match with someone on a dating site that also watches Chainsaw Man.
Therefore, the idea formed of a dating site where users can input not just the kind of things they like, but very specific interests, and then search for others with the same interests so they know about some things they have in common before they meet.
I'd be creating something that allowed me to show my coding skills, my interests/hobbies and also potentially create something that might actually work in the real world in the future.

## Features
- Working signup/login system created with PHP and relational SQL databases. Taking steps to assure user safety with methods such as by password encrypting and prepared statements to prevent injection attacks.
- Index page that changes when a user is logged in or logged out.
- Working sign up and log in pages that contain validation.
- Profile page that automatically populates the page based on user data entered on signup (name, age, gender, location, etc.).
- Interactivity - User can add interest categories (video games, movies, sports, books, etc.), select which categories they'd like to view and then add specific interests (specific games they like, sports they play, books they've read, etc.). The database is automatically updated so that these interest categories and specific interests are saved. Deleting is also fully functional.
- Use of HTML, CSS, Javascript, JQuery (ajax requests), PHP and SQL.
